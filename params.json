  "body": "# My-C-Practice\r\n\r\nAssortment of C Programs I wrote During my 3rd Semester **Data Structres and Algorithms** Course.\r\n\r\n*All the programs were written on Ubuntu and run using GCC Compiler.*\r\n**Most of them have Sufficient Comments for Understanding the code.**\r\n\r\nThe Repo has 5 folders listed below with details :\r\n### 1. Data Structures and Algorithms\r\nContains Programs which I wrote as a part of my course , It includes with their associated functions like *push , pop* etc \r\n* Implementation of stack using array ,Link list and queue\r\n* Implementation of  linked list\r\n* Implementaion of queue\r\n* Implementaion of weighted and unweighted graph adjacency matrix\r\n* Binary Search Tree.\r\n\r\n### 2. Fun but Tough \r\nThese are the programs that I wrote just for the heck of it and I am quite proud of some of them\r\n+ **Balancer** : This program takes input string containing of  *parenthesis* ( closed and open )  and tells us whether the parenthesis are balanced or not. Uses *stack*.\r\n+ **Alpha Count** (*Run this, it's Cool*) : Enter a text file in arguement and it will give you a horizontal histogram of the frequency of  alphabets . See code for demo.\r\n+ **Base Converter** : Enter a number in decimal and a target  base and output will be the converted number in target base. *Pretty Cool Huh!!* \r\n\r\n### 3. K and R Solutions\r\nIf you have not heard of K&R and you are a computer undergrad then you better go and google it .\r\nHere is the link [Buy it here](http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8120305965/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&creativeASIN=8120305965&linkCode=as2&tag=gbuonline00-21) , Written by guys who ceated **C**.\r\nThis folder contains solutions to some of the problems of 1st chapter.\r\n\r\n### 4. Simple Algo\r\nThis folder contains basic sorting programs such as **binary** and **bubble** sort .It also has Searching Programs  and some counting programs which count white spaces ,newlines and tabs.\r\n\r\n### 5. Basics\r\nThis has very basic level programs of matrix , pattern printing,factorial etc.\r\n___\r\n#### *See code for instructions how to run and what ouput to expect.* ####\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
